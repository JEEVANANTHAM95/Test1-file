           Nestled in the New York Catskill Mountains on ninety three acres of land and forest, the 
           Blue Deer Center is embraced by “Saskawhihiwine,” the river of peace. This land, known for
           millennia, as a place where conflict is resolved and illness gives way to health. 
           Blessed things happen here that cannot happen even a short distance away, for this sacred 
           place offers unique medicine that restore and heal.
